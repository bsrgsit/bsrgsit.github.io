    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Principal Engineer with 12+ years transforming enterprise infrastructure and embracing 
      cutting-edge AI technologies. On the infrastructure side, I architect and deploy Red Hat 
      OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) and Mirantis environments with OpenDaylight integration, 
      specializing in VNF onboarding and service orchestration. My automation frameworks using 
      Ansible and Ansible Tower have delivered $1M in annual cost savings while eliminating vendor 
      dependencies. On the AI and application side, I'm actively working with Model Context Protocol 
      (MCP), AI Agents, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, deploying these solutions 
      securely on private cloud environments. Throughout my career, I've established design principles 
      for scalable, resilient, and maintainable systems, ensuring enterprise-grade reliability and 
      performance. This dual expertise bridges traditional enterprise infrastructure with next-generation 
      AI capabilities.
